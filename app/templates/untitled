Assignment (Reading)

(1) Close everything.

(2) Write a Python script that loads the event_signups.csv file and prints out each person's first name.

Use your template!!!!!!
Remember that you'll also need to look at the csv file to find out in which cell the first name is stored!!!!




(If you're done and you want a challenge: do the same thing, but only print out first names that start with 'D'. This requires you to add one more line of code before your print statement.)




===============================================

Assignment (Writing)

(1) Close everything
(2) Open a Python script that assigns four lists, one for each person in the class. Each list has their:

aliya = ['Aliya', 'Blackandred', 'Daal and rice', 'Prince']
angie = [
aurea = []
dago = []


(3) Then, underneath your list assignments, use the csv write code to create a csv that contains this info.
